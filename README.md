# Numerical Methods for Time Dependent PDEs

Git repository for the assignments and extras for the MasterMath course *Numerical Methods for Time Dependent PDEs* in the summer semester 2021
## Assigment 1
* Jupyter Notebook that solves three different time-dependent PDEs, namely
  *   Richards equation from porous media flow;
  *   The modelling of propagation of domain walls in liquid crystals;
  *   The equal width (EW) wave equation.
* The results can be found in the Notebook and PDF, but here are some nice videos of the more interesting results

## Heat 2D
* Jupyter Notebook to solve the 2D heat equation using python with the following methods
  * Forward in time, centered in space (FTCS) method
  * Crank-Nicolson (CN)
  * Alternating direction method (ADI)
